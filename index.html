        <h1>Edge</h1>
        
        <p><b>Edge</b> is a new static generator.</p>
        
        <p><b>Edge is onworking. Do not clone or do any changes. No P.R will be merged</b></p>
        
        <p>Also <b>Edge</b> means: <i>the outside limit of an object, area, or surface</i>.</p>
        
        <h3>What is exactly edge doing?</h3>
        
        <b>Edge</b> is a simple static generator written in Python. <b>Edge</b> has no high level core or libraries. Up next, I will teach you how to use <b>Edge</b> for your blogs.
        
        <h3>How to download and setup a blog?</h3>
        
        <p><b>Edge</b> stable version will be out soon. This is the first Concept of the program.</p>
        
        <h3>How do I use Edge?</h3>
        
        <b>Edge</b> is a command line program. There is no GUI version of it. When you install and config it, you are able to build your blog with these simple commands.
        
        <h3>How to create a post?</h3>
        
        <code>
        $ edge --new <name> <language>
        </code>
        
        <p>When you want to create a post, you should use <code>--new</code> command. After <code>--new</code> enter the name and the language of the post.</p>
        
        <p>If your post is an English post, use <code>--en</code> and if it is Persian, use <code>--fa</code>.</p>
        
        <code>
        $ edge --new hello --fa
        </code>
        
        Other commands for **Updating** and others, will be wrote in <b>Edge</b> documentations. Now this project is not the stable and completed version. Just a part of the programm.
        
        <!-- <b>How to config Edge?</b>
        
        <p>There is a <code>config</code> directory that includes a <code>config.py</code> file. In this version, config file just has one value but in main version, you should add time zone**, **Author** and other things. The main value is **Outout directory**. All of posts will be in output directory. So you should tell the app what is your output directory.</p>
        
        <p>If you are using <b>Github Pages</b>, write <code>docs<code> in the value.</p>
        
        <p>So, Simple. <code>docs<code> dir is the **Output dir**. In <code>docs<code> we have 2 directories, <code>posts<code> and <code>static<code>. <code>posts<code> include all of the posts and the main page.</p>
        
        <p>In <code>static<code> there are styles, js files, fonts.</p>
        
        <p>Back in pre directory, <code>config<code> is the directory that has <code>config.py<code> file.</p>
        
        <p>In <code>files<code>, there are 2 files. <code>fa.html<code> for Persian and <code>en.html<code> for English posts.</p>
        
        <p>So, we all know what is <code>LICENSE<code> and <code>README<code>. The <code>main.py<code> is the <b>Edge</b> file.</p>
        
        <p><b>Remember. This version is not the main version. This is just for tests and people feedbacks</b></p> -->
